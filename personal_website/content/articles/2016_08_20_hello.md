Title: print("Hello World!")

Hello there. I decided to write down a blog on my personal website. I will write about multiple things:

- My programming adventures and things I have learned,
- Tutorials on programming and project management,
- Conferences and places I visited,
- My thoughts on topics of interest,
- ... and more!

I want to structure what I learn and experience, so this will be a way to "bookmark" my memories. If you find something here that will help you out, then even better!

Welcome to my world.
