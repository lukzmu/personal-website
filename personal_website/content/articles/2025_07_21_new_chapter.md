Title: A new chapter for technical writing
Date: 2025-07-21 10:00
Status: draft

Hello there!

I've been thinking deeply about this for quite some time now: getting back into technical writing. I used to have a blog “back in the old days” when I was still at university. Now that I’ve accumulated more work experience, I’ve decided it’s time to investigate some topics and maybe write them down for my future self.

**Core ideas behind the blog:**

- Investigating `Python` topics, both old and new,
- Writing tutorials on packages I’ve found interesting or useful,
- Scribbling down thoughts on technology.

**What this endeavor is not about:**

- I’m not doing this for fame — just creating a space for my own thoughts,
- I won’t be adding any monetization or trackers to the site,
- I'm not going to crosspost to other blogging platforms, only share links to here.

Thanks for reading, and see you soon!
