Title: A new beginning for my blog site
Date: 2026-02-10 10:00

A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I wrote several blog posts about technology, robotics, and generally nerdy things. Most of those are lost to the void (unless you dig through the Wayback Machine - I’ll try to bring them back into my archive). That was a period when I was learning a lot, mostly during my university years. As time went by, more responsibilities arrived, and I dropped the idea of writing.

Recently, as I’ve been diving deeper into data‑engineering topics, I thought, “How cool it would be to start writing again.” It isn’t even about boosting my internet presence; it’s more about how writing helped me learn things in the past, and perhaps it can help me now.

Over the next days, months... eons? I don’t think I’ll achieve immortality. Still, I’ll soon be posting here about my programming and data journey, so feel free to read along, for better or worse.

Until we meet again!
